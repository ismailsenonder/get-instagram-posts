# Get Instagram Posts
C# code to retrieve instagram posts as json string or class object

## important notes
- You need instagram access token to retrieve data. For more information: Google  
- If you need to convert json string to a class object and loop through, the code has Newtonsoft.Json dependency.  
- The code was originally written for a .Net Core console project but it can be used in any project type on both .Net Standart and .Net Core. Just copy the method and paste it in your code.
